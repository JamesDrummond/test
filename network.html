<th align="left">Eclipse Che is making connections between three essential entities: the browser, the Che server, and a machine which is typically running a Docker container. There are configuration steps that you must take if these services are distributed, or you want to run them on IP addresses that do not have external public access. Generally, if the browser client that is accessing Che and the workspaces that it are connecting to are both on <code>localhost</code>, then the Che startup scripts configure everything for the user. You will need to reconfigure Che with certain properties to support it running behind a firewall or in a hosted scenario. This guide is a companion to <a href="https://eclipse-che.readme.io/v4.4/docs/che-as-a-server">Configuration: Che as a Server</a> which walks through the items that you must configure step by step to verify Che operates in a hosted capacity. This networking guide is provided as a specification. This page is a companion to the: ## <em>Four Deployment Configurations</em> There are four basic configurations in which you can deploy Che. | Che? | Workspaces? | OS | Description | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Native Process | Native Docker | Linux | The Che app server runs as a native process on your node. Workspaces are generated as Docker containers. The Docker daemon is running on the same node. The Che app server and Docker container may have different IP addresses on the same node.<br/><br/>The default settings of the Che boot scripts on Linux assume this configuration. | | Native Process | VM Docker | Any | Since Docker is not natively supported on many operating systems, you can launch a VM running a boot2docker ISO that provides an OS for Docker containers.<br/><br/>The Che app server runs as a native process on your node. Worskpaces are generated using Docker that is running inside a VM. There can be up to three IP addresses: the Che server, the VM, and the container.<br/><br/>The default settings of the Che boot scripts on Mac and Windows assume this configuration. | | Native Docker | Native Docker | Linux | You can run Che inside of a Docker container, which itself is independently started and stopped. The workspaces created by Che are created using the same Docker daemon and created as sibling containers. | | VM Docker | VM Docker | Any | Same as the previous configuration, but all Docker containers are created by the Docker daemon running within the VM. | ## <em>Native Process for Che, Native Docker for Workspaces</em></th>

<td align="left">The browser client initiates communication with the Che Server by connecting to <code>che-ip</code>. This IP address must be accessible by your browser clients.

<p>There are multiple techniques for connecting to Docker including Unix sockets, localhost, and remote connections over TCP protocol. Depending upon the type of connection you require and the location of the machine node running Docker, we use different parameters.</p>

You can override <code>che-host</code> with your own IP address that points to the Che server.</p>
<p>You can set the <code>CHE_DOCKER_MACHINE_HOST</code> environment variable by exporting the variable in your Linux configuration or on the Che command line with <code>--remote:ip</code> option.</p>
<p>Properties are added and changed in <code>${CHE_LOCAL_CONF_DIR}/che.properties</code></p>
<h4 id="firewall"><em>Firewall</em></h4>
<p>On Linux, a firewall may block inbound connections from within Docker containers to your localhost network. As a result, the workspace agent is unable to ping the Che server. You can check for the firewall and then disable it.</p>

<hr />
<p>You can run Docker in a VM and enable Che to create workspaces using the embedded Docker daemon. If you are on Linux, this is optional. If you are on OSX or Windows, this is mandatory as Docker is not yet supported natively on those operating systems. We use VirtualBox to launch and manage VMs that run a special operating system optimized for executing Docker containers. This VM type is called <code>boot2docker</code> and it is maintained by the Docker community. <code>docker-machine</code> is a command line utility to simplify the creation and destruction of VMs that have <code>boot2docker</code>.</p>

<p>This configuration introduces a third IP addresses, <code>vm-ip</code>, which is the externally accessible IP address of the VM that has the Docker daemon. Your browser clients communicate to <code>vm-ip</code> in this configuration, not <code>workspace-ip</code>.</p>

<p>Che heavily relies on WebSocket communications. When a browser client connects to a workspace, it connects to it through WebSockets. Inside the workspace, the workspace agent also uses WebSockets to connect back to the Che server.</p>
<p>If WebSockets are blocked or not supported in the network, the workspace startup will fail with an error.</p>
